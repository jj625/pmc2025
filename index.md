Dear friends and colleagues,

I hope you've been well. Two years ago, your support for my son's cancer research fundraiser (<a href="https://pmc.org">https://pmc.org</a>) meant a great deal to us&mdash;both the donations and your encouragement.

This year, on August 2<sup>nd</sup> 2025, he's at it again, rallying support for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and we'd be incredibly grateful if you could help us <i><u>spread the word</u></i>. Whether it's forwarding this note/email, sharing with friends, or even posting it on social media, every bit of awareness makes a difference. Research institutions like Dana-Farber are facing significant funding cuts to federal funding for cancer research (see this <a
href="https://www.fightcancer.org/releases/future-cancer-cures-jeopardy-president-proposes-massive-cuts-national-cancer-institute">link</a>).

Here's the link to the campaign: <a

Of course, donations are welcome, but this time our biggest ask is simply helping others learn about it. Thank you again for being part of this journey&mdash;we couldn't do it without you.

Have a look at this <a
