<p>Dear friends and colleagues,</p>

<p>I hope you've been well. <span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'>Two years
ago, your support for my son's cancer research fundraiser (<a href="https://pmc.org">https://pmc.org</a>)
meant a great deal to us&mdash;both the donations and your encouragement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>This year, on August 2<sup>nd</sup> 2025,
he's at it again, rallying support for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and we'd
be incredibly grateful if you could help us <i><u>spread the word</u></i>.
Whether it's forwarding this email, sharing with friends, or even posting it on
social media, every bit of awareness makes a difference. Research institutions like
Dana-Farber are facing significant funding cuts to federal funding for cancer
research (see this <a
href="https://www.fightcancer.org/releases/future-cancer-cures-jeopardy-president-proposes-massive-cuts-national-cancer-institute">link</a>).</p>

<p>Here's the link to the campaign: <a

<p>Of course, donations are welcome, but this time our biggest ask is simply helping others learn about it. Thank you again
for being part of this journey'we couldn't do it
without you.</p>

<p>I took this <a

start line two years ago! </p>

<p>Warmly,</p>

<p>Jimmy Jusuf</p>
